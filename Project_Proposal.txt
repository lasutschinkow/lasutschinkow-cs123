Project Proposal



Main idea/question : Based on popular music data, is it possible to build a model 
that can accurately predict what year a song was released based on the other characteristics of the song?


Data : Million Song Dataset ( http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/ )

Approach to the Data : There are several characteristics of a song that have the potential to be 
shared by other songs in its year (for example: key, tempo, time signature, etc.), and it is likely that,
if patterns do exist, some combinations of these characteristics are much better at determining accurate
predictions than others. In creating a model, different combinations will be tried to see which provide
the most predictive powere without becoming overly restrictive. Some useful computational tools include 
multiple passes of MapReduce implementing a k-nearest-neighbors algorithm.

First implementation : For the first implementation of the model, I will use a restricted dataset (both
in number of songs and metadata fields considered) and will see which combinations of fields from the
restricted list lead to the best predictive power. The prediction will be : given a song, can we
predict the year of the song's release based on other relevant characteristics?

Final implementation : A model that takes all songs in the database (or at least all songs for which
the relevant metadata is available) and an expanded range of metadata fields. The model will test
various combinations and return those that have the greatest predictive power. It would also be interesting
to have predictions going both ways : in addition to the year-prediction of the initial model, do any years
have a "stereotypical" song which can be constructed from the data? It would also be interesting to graph
the results of nearest-neighbors or clustering algorithms to support these results.
