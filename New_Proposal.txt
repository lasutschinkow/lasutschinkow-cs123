Finding important pages via discrepencies between probablistic hits and actual hits

Probablistic hits:
- Build a graph using wikilinks data (in and out links)
- Calculate hit ratios supposing it were a closed system and everyone surfed at random.
    * Do this with a transition matrix
    * Should we multiply it by itself until it stabilizes? 
    * Or take into account the fact that people only look at a few pages before leaving, and do it to that power?
    * The latter would mean that when we compare, we're really comparing the difference due to two factors: unequal likelihood of starting pages, and unequal likelihood of link follows, which is what we want.

Actual hits:
- The actual hits.

Comparison step:
- Convert actual hits into hit shares (page hits / total hits)
- Take difference between probablistic hits and actual hits
- Find which pages have the biggest differences (positve and negative)
- Can we graph this against some second variable?
