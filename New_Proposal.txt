Finding important pages via discrepencies between probablistic hits and actual hits

Probablistic hits:
- Build a graph using wikilinks data (in and out links)
- Calculate hit ratios supposing it were a closed system and everyone surfed at random.
    * Do this with a transition matrix
    ? Should we multiply it by itself until it stabilizes? 
    ? Or take into account the fact that people only look at a few pages before leaving, and do it to that power?
    ? The latter would mean that when we compare, we're really comparing the difference due to two factors: unequal likelihood of starting pages, and unequal likelihood of link follows, which is what we want? Is it? IDK I asked Prof Rogers.

Actual hits:
- The actual hits.

Comparison step:
- Convert actual hits into hit shares (page hits / total hits)
- Take difference between probablistic hits and actual hits
- Find which pages have the biggest differences (positve and negative)
- Can we graph this against some second variable?
    ? like maybe the inlink/outlink ratio? If you have a low inlink/outlink ratio, that means there aren't a lot of pages that link to you (comparatively speaking), so you must be a favored starting point.
    ? Would have to calibrate this -- inlink/outlink ratio already affects the probablistic hit calculation
? Could we somehow separate the "genuinely important" pages, and the pages that simply feed off its importantness?
